# weatherApp


About The Project:
This project is to create a simple weather app. The user can search for a city and it will return some weather details for the current day. It will also return a 5 day forecast. I have used the openweather map api to get the data, 3 different URLS - one for the lat and lon, one for the temp, wind speed, humidty and icon and one for the UV index. There is also some logic ont he UV index to display it in red, orange or green box depending on the value.
After a search is completed the city searched will appear as a button to allow the user to search for this city again without needing to type it again.

Built With:
HTML CSS Javascript and jQuery.

User Instructions: 
Enter a city into the search form and click search. Enter another city and search again. The user can also click on a previous search button to return that city again.

Roadmap:
The current product satisfies all of the acceptance criteria but some future improvements I will look to include are:
Add a clear button to remove the text in search bar
Code refactor, remove repeated code.
Use animations for weather.
Improve the responsive display - it will display differently on smaller screens but it could be improved.
