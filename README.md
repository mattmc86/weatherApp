# weatherApp

Remove bootstrap and rebuild with CSS
Display saved searches correctly - think I need to have a foreach loop to create a button and add the cityName into that button
                                   also need to add event listner to call getAPI when these buttons are clicked

Add UV index
Add weather icon - I think this is not working for two reasons - I can;t seem to get back the icon code to use in the URL and
                    also even if I oculd I dont think its able to pass this into the new function

Add dates

Add 5 day forecast - I think this is similar to above, I have a function to search a different api and the cityName is used 
                     as parameter, I'm using this when calling the function from inside my main function but it doesnt seem     
                     to be able to get it



If finished then:


clear text from search bar after search
